## How We Compare Email Verification Services

Our comparison methodology focuses on several key factors to ensure you get a complete picture of how services stack up against each other:

### Accuracy Testing

We run identical test lists through each service to measure:
- **False positives** (marking valid emails as invalid)
- **False negatives** (marking invalid emails as valid)
- **Overall accuracy rates**

### Feature Comparison

We analyze the complete feature set of each service, including:
- **Verification methods** (syntax, domain, mailbox checks)
- **Advanced detection** (disposable emails, spam traps, catch-all domains)
- **Data enrichment** (gender detection, name validation, etc.)
- **API capabilities** and limitations
- **Integration options** with email marketing platforms

### Pricing Analysis

We break down the pricing structure to determine:
- **Cost per verification** at different volume levels
- **Value for money** based on features offered
- **Hidden costs** or additional fees
- **Subscription vs. pay-as-you-go** options

### Usability Evaluation

We assess the user experience:
- **Dashboard functionality** and reporting
- **Ease of uploading lists**
- **Speed of verification**
- **Developer-friendliness** of API
- **Quality of documentation**

### Support Quality

We evaluate customer support by testing:
- **Response times**
- **Support channels** (email, chat, phone)
- **Knowledge base** comprehensiveness
- **Onboarding process**

Use our detailed comparisons to find the perfect match for your email verification needs, whether you're looking for the most affordable option, the most feature-rich platform, or the service with the best API for developers.
