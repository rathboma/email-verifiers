## Why Use an Email Verification API?

Real-time email verification through an API offers significant advantages over batch verification for many use cases:

- **Immediate Validation**: Verify emails at the point of collection
- **Better User Experience**: Catch typos and mistakes before form submission
- **Reduced Friction**: Prevent users from needing to confirm or correct their email later
- **Higher Data Quality**: Maintain clean data from the start
- **Cost Efficiency**: Only verify new emails rather than repeatedly cleaning entire lists

In this comparison, we'll evaluate the leading email verification APIs based on their implementation ease, performance, accuracy, and overall developer experience.

## API Implementation Comparison

## Integration Examples

### Form Integration

Here's a simple example of integrating Kickbox verification with a web form using JavaScript:

{% highlight javascript %}
document.getElementById('email-form').addEventListener('submit', async function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  
  const email = document.getElementById('email-input').value;
  const feedback = document.getElementById('email-feedback');
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-backend/verify-email', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ email })
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (result.deliverable) {
      feedback.textContent = 'Email is valid!';
      feedback.className = 'success';
      this.submit();
    } else if (result.suggested_correction) {
      feedback.textContent = `Did you mean ${result.suggested_correction}?`;
      feedback.className = 'warning';
    } else {
      feedback.textContent = 'Please enter a valid email address.';
      feedback.className = 'error';
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Verification failed:', error);
    feedback.textContent = 'Unable to verify email. Please try again.';
    feedback.className = 'error';
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

Backend implementation with Node.js and Kickbox:

```
const express = require('express');
const Kickbox = require('kickbox');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

const kickbox = Kickbox.client('your_api_key').kickbox();

app.post('/verify-email', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email } = req.body;
    
    if (!email) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email is required' });
    }
    
    const result = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      kickbox.verify(email, (err, response) => {
        if (err) reject(err);
        else resolve(response.body);
      });
    });
    
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Verification error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Verification failed' });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## API Pricing Comparison

Pricing models for API access vary significantly between providers:

| Provider | Starting Price | Enterprise Pricing | Free Tier |
